## Description

This is an Elixir Mix project which uses the [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/current) api to get the temperature of a city. This project was built by following lessons from [The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Elixir-OTP-Guidebook/dp/1633430111) chapter 2.

## Set-Up

Add the `.env`  to the root of the project. In it add your api key, example `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=VALUE`.
